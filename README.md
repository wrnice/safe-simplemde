This is a fork of the simplemde  (https://simplemde.com) markdown editor, modified for use in the Safe network.

-links should be safe:// instead of http://

-images should be safe:// instead of http://

-stripped any external requests

-TODO : the Safe browser  ( electron ) doesn't support prompt -> find a workaround


Beware this is probably not going to be maintained !
